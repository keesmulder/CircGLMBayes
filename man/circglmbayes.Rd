\title{circglmbayes: A package for the Bayesian circular GLM.}
\description{
This package contains functions to perform a Bayesian circular GLM, which
allows regressing a circular outcome on linear and categorical predictors.
The model used in this package is similar to the model used by
\code{lm.circular} form the package \code{circular}. Differences are that the model used
by this package treats categorical variables specially. In addition, several
hypothesis testing options are provided.
}
\details{
Estimation and uncertainty intervals are all performed in a Bayesian manner
through MCMC. Bayesian hypothesis tests are provided through the Bayes
factor.
}
\section{Functions}{
 The main function of the package is
  \code{\link{circGLM}}, which runs an MCMC sampler in \code{C++} through
  \code{Rcpp}. This sampler returns an S3 object of type
  \code{circGLM}, which can be further analyzed through associated
  \code{\link{plot.circGLM}} and \code{\link{print.circGLM}} functions.
